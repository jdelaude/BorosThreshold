# 🜊 The Riemann Hypothesis 🜊 10.5281/zenodo.15445550

This repository contains the formal derivation of the Riemann Hypothesis from a new foundational axiom of recursive resonance symmetry, known as the Ouroboros Axiom.

> Ω = F(Ω)

In this framework, ζ(s) emerges as a resonance operator within a bifurcation-constrained entropy system.  
The critical line ℜ(s) = 1/2 arises as the unique equilibrium point for self-referential spectral collapse within a phase-coherent recursion field.

**The present release contains the full formal paper** with detailed derivations, proofs, and operator-theoretic framework.
