# The Ouroboros Threshold: A Recursive Derivation of the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository contains a formal derivation of the Riemann Hypothesis from a new foundational axiom of recursive resonance symmetry, known as the Ouroboros Axiom.

> â„¦ = F(â„¦)

In this framework, Î¶(s) emerges as a resonance operator within a bifurcation-constrained entropy system. The critical line â„œ(s) = 1/2 arises as the unique equilibrium point for self-referential spectral collapse.
