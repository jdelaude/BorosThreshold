# The Ouroboros Threshold: A Recursive Derivation of the Riemann Hypothesis

This repository contains an abstract-level formalism outlining a recursive derivation of the Riemann Hypothesis from a foundational axiom of self-referential resonance symmetry, known as the Ouroboros Axiom.

> â„¦ = F(â„¦)

In this framework, Î¶(s) is interpreted as a resonance operator within a bifurcation-constrained entropy system. The critical line â„œ(s) = 1/2 emerges as the unique equilibrium point of self-reinforcing spectral symmetry collapse.

The full derivation is timestamped, layered, and not publicly disseminated. Redistribution, citation, or derivative use without prior authorization is prohibited.
